After a period of discussions the Marxist Group ‘Class Politics’ (MGKP), a Trotskyist organization in Russia, and the Revolutionary Communist International Tendency (RCIT) have decided to collaborate.

Given the importance of Russia as an imperialist rival to other Great Powers (U.S., EU, China, Japan) the RCIT and MGKP announce their intention to intensify their efforts to deepen their analysis of Russian capitalism as well as to jointly develop and fight for a revolutionary program in that country. Furthermore we will develop joint statements on important issues of the world class struggle. Finally, we intend to prepare the political basis for fusing our organizations. In this process we will work on joint statements and translations of important documents.

In the coming period we will also focus on discussing remaining differences which we hope to overcome (e.g. conditions for critical electoral support for reformist parties, when to apply support for the right of national self-determination of oppressed people, estimation of the first period of the civil war in the Ukraine in 2014, assessment of nuclear power and various others).

We call upon revolutionaries in Russia and internationally to join us in our struggle to rebuild a revolutionary World Party – an international party determined to fight for socialist revolution!
